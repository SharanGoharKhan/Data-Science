    "Build a \"mimic\" dict that maps each word that appears in the file to a list of all the words that immediately follow that word in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of words can be in any order and should include duplicates. So for example the key \"and\" might have the list [\"then\", \"best\", \"then\", \"after\", ...] listing all the words which came after \"and\" in the text. We'll say that the empty string is what comes before the first word in the file.\n",

    "With the mimic dict, it's fairly easy to emit random text that mimics the original. Print a word, then look up what words might come next and pick one at random as the next work.\n",
